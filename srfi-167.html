    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>This library describes an interface for an ordered key-value
      store that is suitable for implementing a storage engine for the
      generic tuple-store SRFI.  It maps cleanly to existing ordered
      key-value databases that may or may not provide transactions.</p>

    <h1>Rationale</h1>

    <p>Ordered key-value stores offer a powerful set of simple and
      elegant primitives to build database abstractions, also
      sometimes called layers.  The
      <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-168/">generic tuple store SRFI</a>
      is an example of such abstraction and other are possible.  A
      standard interface for such databases will allow more people to
      experiment with databases in Scheme.</p>

    <p>While it has not been Scheme force to power databases.  The
       recent uprising of several ordered key-value stores make the
       idea of building databases with Scheme more applicable as the
       performance concerns are solved by lower level languages.</p>

    <p>The author argues that getting started with data management
       systems with ordered key-value stores is easier to the
       mind and also reflects the modern industrial pratice that
       builds (distributed) databases systems possibly with SQL
       support on top of ordered key-value stores. Otherwise said,
       this SRFI should offer grounds for apprentices to learn
       about data storage.  It will also offer a better story
       (the best?) to data durability in Scheme implementations.</p>

    <p>This SRFI does not overlap with existing SRFIs and complements
       <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-168/">generic tuple
       store SRFI</a>.</p>

    <h1>Specification</h1>
    <h2 id="okvs-and-transaction">Okvs and Transaction</h2>

    <p>A okvs is a mapping that may or may not support
      transactions.  Keys are lexicographically ordered bytevectors.
      Values are bytevectors.</p>

    <p>The following specification defines two disjoint types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>okvs</code> is a handle to the data storage</li>
      <li><code>transaction</code> is a handle to a currently running
        transaction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="okvs-config"><code>(okvs [config])</code></h3>

    <p>Return a okvs object.  <code>CONFIG</code> is an optional parameter.
      In the case where <code>CONFIG</code> is provided it must be an association
      list.  It allows to configure the underlying database connection.  It
      might be the path to the directory or file where the data is stored or
      the location of a configuration file or the host and port in case the
      database is accessed over the network.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-close-okvs-config"><code>(okvs-close okvs [config])</code></h3>

    <p>Close <code>OKVS</code>. <code>CONFIG</code> is optional.  In the
       case where it is provided, it must be an association list. It is
       implementation dependent.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-begin-okvs-config"><code>(okvs-begin okvs [config])</code></h3>

    <p>Start a transaction and return a transaction object.
      <code>CONFIG</code> is optional and allows to configure the transaction.
      In the case where it is provided it must be an association list. It
      is implementation dependent.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-commit-transaction-config"><code>(okvs-commit transaction config)</code></h3>

    <p>Commit <code>TRANSACTION</code>.  <code>CONFIG</code> is optional. In
       the case where <code>CONFIG</code> is provided it must be an association
       list.  It allows to configure the transaction.  It is implementation dependent.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-rollback-transaction-config"><code>(okvs-rollback transaction [config])</code></h3>

    <p>Roll back <code>TRANSACTION</code>.  <code>CONFIG</code> is optional. In
       the case where <code>CONFIG</code> is provided it must be an association
       list.  It is implementation dependent.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-ref-transaction-key"><code>(okvs-ref transaction key)</code></h3>

    <p>Return the bytevector associated with <code>KEY</code>
      bytevector using <code>TRANSACTION</code>.  If there is no such
      key, return <code>#f</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-set-transaction-key-value"><code>(okvs-set! transaction key value)</code></h3>

    <p>Associate <code>KEY</code> bytevector with <code>VALUE</code>
      bytevector using <code>TRANSACTION</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-rm-transaction-key"><code>(okvs-rm! transaction key)</code></h3>

    <p>Delete the pair associated with <code>KEY</code> bytevector
      using <code>TRANSACTION</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="okvs-range-transaction-prefix-config"><code>(okvs-range transaction prefix [CONFIG])</code></h3>

    <p>Return a SRFI 158 generator of key-value pairs where keys
       starts with <code>PREFIX</code> bytevector.  The stream must
       lexicographically ordered.  <code>PREFIX</code> can be the empty
       bytevector, in which case the all the pairs are returned in a
       generator.  <code>CONFIG</code> is optional.  In the case where
       <code>CONFIG</code> is provided it must be an association list.
       It is implementation dependent.</p>

    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <p>The <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-167/srfi-167.tgz">sample
      implementation</a> relies on scheme mappings (SRFI 146) and
      generators and accumulators (SRFI 158).</p>
